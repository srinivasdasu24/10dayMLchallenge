Day 3: We have already Learned about Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering. Let's take a Step Ahead and Learn How to actually Build ML Models and Train them.

To start with here are some basic types of ML problems and some Resources:
1. ML | Types of Learning by GeeksforGeeks https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-types-learning-supervised-learning/
2. Which Machine Learning model to use?: https://towardsdatascience.com/which-machine-learning-model-to-use-db5fdf37f3dd
3. Classification problem: https://towardsdatascience.com/solving-a-simple-classification-problem-with-python-fruits-lovers-edition-d20ab6b071d2
4. Regression Problem: https://towardsdatascience.com/solving-regression-problems-by-combining-statistical-learning-with-machine-learning-82949f7ac18a
5: Official Documentation: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html

Task:
Do the modeling for these Datasets:
a) Predict Loan_Status (http://iali.in/datasets/loan_status_train.csv)
b) Predict rating (http://iali.in/datasets/cereal.csv)
